# Chemometrics for Analytical Chemistry Using Python

---
**Note: this might seem a lofty plan, as there're a lot to do. Currently only codes for I-MR chart are developped and stored under 4.6.Shewhart Charts.**

## Introduction
This repository contains Python codes for people who're interested in learning Chemometrics using Python as the tool
in stead of commercial statistical softwares.The knowledge behind the Python codes are mainly based on the Chemometrics book by Miller [1].

One might find the codes useful in the following application pharmaceutical manfacturing areas:
1. Control Charts (I-MR, or Shewhart charts) for process and quality monitoring (In-Process Control, Finished Product Testing, Stability Testing).
2. Cusum chart for use in microbiological observations.
2. Linear Regression, for analytical method validation or routine testing.
3. Partial least squares regression for FT-NIR.
4. etc

## Intended Audiences
1. People who want learn chemometrics and Python programming.
2. People who work in pharmacetucal quality function, and who need to deal with statistical assessment without using commercial statistical software.


## Environments
The codes are devloped with the following environments:
1. IDE: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 1.52.1. 
2. Interpreter: Python 3.6.5 from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) 4.8.4
